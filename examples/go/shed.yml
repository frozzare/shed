# We can deploy to a docker-machine instead of local machine.
# docker:
  # machine: shed.com

# Setting a branch name will allow us to deploy without a git repository.
git:
  branch: golang

# Base host that will be used for subdomain (branch name + host, e.g: master.shed.dev)
host: shed.dev

# We can override any setting matching a branch name.
# branches:
#  master:
#    host: shed.dev
